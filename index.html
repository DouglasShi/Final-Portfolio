    <div class="TextSub1">
        <P>According to the most famous fashion designer Karl Lagerfield, elegance is not the pursuit of extravagant outfits, but an attitude of life. Therefore, for our FF30 movie festival project, we invited random students in the campus of NYUAD to confidently present their outfits of the day on our non-existent catwalk. Through this project, we want to spread the idea that elegance and fashion has nothing to do with who you are, where you are, and what are you wearing.</P>

When you are at the stratosphere level, you will be able to see the supersonic military jet and some beautiful weather balloons. The higher up you go into the sky, the darker your environment would be. In your last stop, the galaxy, our environment would turn into complete darkness and you would be able to see stars, spaceships, and satellites that go around the earth.</P>
